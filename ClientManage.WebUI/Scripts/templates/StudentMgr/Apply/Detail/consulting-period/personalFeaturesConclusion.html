This replaces the contents of the region with the view's el / content. You can override attachHtml for transition effects and more.

Marionette.Region.prototype.attachHtml = function(view){
this.$el.hide();
this.$el.html(view.el);
this.$el.slideDown("fast");
}
It is also possible to define a custom render method for a single region by extending from the Region class and including a custom attachHtml method.

This example will make a view slide down from the top of the screen instead of just appearing in place:

var ModalRegion = Marionette.Region.extend({
attachHtml: function(view){
// Some effect to show the view:
this.$el.empty().append(view.el);
this.$el.hide().slideDown('fast');
}
})

MyApp.addRegions({
mainRegion: '#main-region',
