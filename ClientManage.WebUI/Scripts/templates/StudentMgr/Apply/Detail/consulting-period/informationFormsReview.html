A region can be reset at any time. This destroys any existing view being displayed, and deletes the cached el. The next time the region shows a view, the region's el is queried from the DOM.

myRegion.reset();
This is useful when regions are re-used across view instances, and in unit testing.

Set How View's el Is Attached

Override the region's attachHtml method to change how the view is attached to the DOM. This method receives one parameter - the view to show.

The default implementation of attachHtml is:

Marionette.Region.prototype.attachHtml = function(view){
this.$el.empty().append(view.el);
}
This replaces the contents of the region with the view's el / content. You can override attachHtml for transition effects and more.

Marionette.Region.prototype.attachHtml = function(view){
this.$el.hide();
this.$el.html(view.el);
this.$el.slideDown("fast");
}
It is also possible to define a custom render method for a single region by extending from the Region class and including a custom attachHtml method.

This example will make a view slide down from the top of the screen instead of just appearing in place:

var ModalRegion = Marionette.Region.extend({
attachHtml: function(view
